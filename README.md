# terraform-aws-jenkins [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/terraform-aws-jenkins.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/terraform-aws-jenkins) [![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/cloudposse/terraform-aws-jenkins.svg)](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-jenkins/releases/latest) [![Slack Community](https://slack.cloudposse.com/badge.svg)](https://slack.cloudposse.com)


`terraform-aws-jenkins` is a Terraform module to build a Docker image with [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/), save it to an [ECR](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/) repo,
and deploy to [Elastic Beanstalk](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/) running [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

This is an enterprise-ready, scalable and highly-available architecture and the CI/CD pattern to build and deploy Jenkins.
## Features

The module will create the following AWS resources:

   * Elastic Beanstalk Application
   * Elastic Beanstalk Environment with Docker stack to run the Jenkins master
   * ECR repository to store the Jenkins Docker image
   * EFS filesystem to store Jenkins config and jobs (it will be mounted to a directory on the EC2 host, and then to the Docker container)
   * CodePipeline with CodeBuild to build and deploy Jenkins so even Jenkins itself follows the CI/CD pattern
   * CloudFormation stack to run a DataPipeline to automatically backup the EFS to S3
   * CloudFormation stack for SNS notifications about the status of each backup


After all of the AWS resources are created,

__CodePipeline__ will:

  * Get the specified Jenkins repo from GitHub, _e.g._ https://github.com/cloudposse/jenkins
  * Build a Docker image from it
  * Save the Docker image to the ECR repo
  * Deploy the Docker image from the ECR repo to Elastic Beanstalk running Docker stack
  * Monitor the GitHub repo for changes and re-run the steps above if new commits are pushed


__DataPipeline__ will run on the specified schedule and will backup all Jenkins files to an S3 bucket by doing the following:

  * Spawn an EC2 instance
  * Mount the EFS filesystem to a directory on the EC2 instance
  * Backup the directory to an S3 bucket
  * Notify about the status of the backup (Success or Failure) via email
  * Destroy the EC2 instance
