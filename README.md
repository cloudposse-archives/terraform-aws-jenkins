# terraform-aws-jenkins [![Codefresh Build Status](https://g.codefresh.io/api/badges/pipeline/cloudposse/terraform-modules%2Fterraform-aws-jenkins?type=cf-1)](https://g.codefresh.io/public/accounts/cloudposse/pipelines/5d9fea1192fba6201f04faca) [![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/cloudposse/terraform-aws-jenkins.svg)](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-jenkins/releases/latest) [![Slack Community](https://slack.cloudposse.com/badge.svg)](https://slack.cloudposse.com)


`terraform-aws-jenkins` is a Terraform module to build a Docker image with [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/), save it to an [ECR](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/) repo,
and deploy to [Elastic Beanstalk](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/) running [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

This is an enterprise-ready, scalable and highly-available architecture and the CI/CD pattern to build and deploy Jenkins.

## Features

The module will create the following AWS resources:

   * Elastic Beanstalk Application
   * Elastic Beanstalk Environment with Docker stack to run the Jenkins master
   * ECR repository to store the Jenkins Docker image
   * EFS filesystem to store Jenkins config and jobs (it will be mounted to a directory on the EC2 host, and then to the Docker container)
   * AWS Backup stack to automatically backup the EFS
   * CodePipeline with CodeBuild to build and deploy Jenkins so even Jenkins itself follows the CI/CD pattern


After all of the AWS resources are created,

__CodePipeline__ will:

  * Get the specified Jenkins repo from GitHub, _e.g._ https://github.com/cloudposse/jenkins
  * Build a Docker image from it
  * Save the Docker image to the ECR repo
  * Deploy the Docker image from the ECR repo to Elastic Beanstalk running Docker stack
  * Monitor the GitHub repo for changes and re-run the steps above if new commits are pushed

We literally have [*hundreds of terraform modules*][terraform_modules] that are Open Source and well-maintained. Check them out! 







## Usage


**IMPORTANT:** The `master` branch is used in `source` just as an example. In your code, do not pin to `master` because there may be breaking changes between releases.
Instead pin to the release tag (e.g. `?ref=tags/x.y.z`) of one of our [latest releases](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-jenkins/releases).


For a complete example, see [examples/complete](examples/complete).

For automatic tests of the complete example, see [test](test).
